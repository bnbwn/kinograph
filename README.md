kinograph
=========

Code for the kinograph project (http://kinograph.cc). This is not publicly released. If you're reading this, you got lucky.

So far, there are two sketches:

mm35_frame_extraction_single

  The original code used for the sequence seen in Kinograph's intro videos. Add a file iterator and it's good to go. I'll upload a batch of 35mm stills for your own use to AmazonS3 soon.
  
mm16_frame_extraction_multiple

  A modified approach focusing on reading brightness data in a binary image to find sprockets. Note that 16mm only has one sprocket per frame while 35mm has 4 per frame.
  This isn't working quite as well as the code for 35mm, but I wanted to take a shot at something different. Feel free to offer suggestions.
  
Now stop snooping.
